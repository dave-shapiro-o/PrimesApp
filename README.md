# PrimesApp
My first Winforms app, implementing a "sieve of Eratosthenes" algorithm.
Finds and displays a list of all primes in a selected range. 
I started with a very simple and slow algorithm. After applying several modifications, it currently finds all
primes below 10^9 in about 40 seconds. Preparing the list for display takes much longer! 
The fastest algorithms that I've seen, using segmented sieving, run 50x plus faster.
